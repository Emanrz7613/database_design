For the feature in v2 of users creating multiple playlists, in order to migrate my schema to v2, I would remove the user_id foreign key contraint from the playlists table and instead create a new table named user_playlists that maps users to playlists. 

For the account type feature in v2, I would add a column to the users table called account_type and add a foreign key contraint to a new table called accounts. The accounts table would have a different account_type and account_description for each type of account. the account_type column in the users table would then map to the account_type in the accounts table.
